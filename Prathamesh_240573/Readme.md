This is a quantum teleportation circuit using Qiskit. The qubit q0 is the unknown state that Alice wants to send to Bob. Alice and Bob share two qubits, q1 and q2, which are connected (entangled).

First, we prepare q1 and q2 in a special entangled state called a Bell state. We do this by applying a Hadamard gate to q1, then a CNOT gate with q1 controlling q2.

Next, we apply another CNOT gate where q0 controls q1, and then apply a Hadamard gate to q0.

After that, Alice measures the states of q0 and q1. She sends the measurement results (classical bits) to Bob.

Finally, using these results, Bob applies some corrections to q2 to recreate the original unknown state q0. This completes the teleportation.
