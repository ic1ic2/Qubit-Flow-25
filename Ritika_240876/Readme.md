## Assignment-1

I implemented the standard quantum teleportation protocol. I Used a random unitary to generate a test quantum state. Then teleported that state from qubit to ebit1. Verified the teleportation by undoing the random gate and checking if I ended up with ∣0⟩.







## Assignment-2

I initialized a 2-spin quantum state, applied the exact Heisenberg time evolution using XX, YY, ZZ interaction gates, 
measured the result, and simulated the experiment to see the final spin states' probabilities.
