# Comparison of 2-spin state and 3-spin state Heisenberg Model

## 2-spin state Heisenberg Model 

Hamiltonian H is defined as $$H = J(X_0 \otimes X_1 + Y_0 \otimes Y_1 + Z_0 \otimes Z_1)$$

The system is initialised in the state |01>. The qubits interact via X $\otimes$ X, Y $\otimes$ Y and the Z $\otimes$ Z gates and on evolution with time, the state oscillates between |01> and |10>. 

## 3- Spin Heisenberg Model

Hamiltonian H is defined as $$H= J(X_0 \otimes X_1 + Y_0 \otimes Y_1 + Z_0 \otimes Z_1 + X_1 \otimes X_2 + Y_1 \otimes Y_2 + Z_1 \otimes Z_2 )$$

In this case, the state is initialised to |001>. Due to the added interactions between the 3 qubits, the state oscillates between |001>, |010> , |100> with time preserving the spin. This results in a more complex probability distribution as compared to the 2-spin state model.
