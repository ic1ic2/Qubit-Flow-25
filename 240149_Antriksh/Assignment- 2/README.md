## Comparison the of 2- Spin and 3- Spin Heisenberg Models

### 2- Spin Heisenberg Model

**Hamiltonian:** $$H= J(X_0 \otimes X_1 + Y_0 \otimes Y_1 + Z_0 \otimes Z_1)$$
In this model, two qubits interact via the X $\otimes$ X, Y $\otimes$ Y and the Z $\otimes$ Z couplings. The system is initialised in the state $\left|01\right\rangle$, and its time evolution shows coeherent oscillations between the $\left|01\right\rangle$ and the $\left|10\right\rangle$ states.

### 3- Spin Heisenberg Model

**Hamiltonian:** $$H= J(X_0 \otimes X_1 + Y_0 \otimes Y_1 + Z_0 \otimes Z_1 + X_1 \otimes X_2 + Y_1 \otimes Y_2 + Z_1 \otimes Z_2 )$$
In this model, the number of qubits is increased to $3$, and the system is initialised in the state $\left|001\right\rangle$. In this case, the probability distribution is split between the states $\left|001\right\rangle$, $\left|010\right\rangle$ and $\left|100\right\rangle$ which represents a more complex and richer quantum transport as compared to the $2$- spin model.
