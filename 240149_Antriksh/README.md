### **Assignment- 1**:
- Creating a Quantum Teleportation circuit using Qiskit and running it on the `AerSimulator`.

---

### **Assignment- 2:**
- Digitally implementing the time- evolution of 2- spin and 3- spin Heisenberg Models on Qiskit.
- Running the simulations on IBM Quantum Hardware and comparing the two models

---

### **Assignment- 3:**
- Investigating how different optimization levels and transpiler stages affect quantum circuit structure and performance.
- Using Qiskit to explore transpilation pipelines, layout, routing, and dynamical decoupling techniques.

---

### **Assignment- 4:**
- Simulating 2- and 3-spin Heisenberg models using `AerSimulator` with and without a noise model from `FakeSherbrooke`, effectively mimicking a QASM simulation with hardware-level noise.
- Analyzing dynamical correlation functions and studied fidelity loss from Trotter and hardware-induced errors.

---

### **Assignment- 5:**
- Comparing traditional and AI-powered transpilation methods using the Qiskit Transpiler Service.
- Measuring improvements in gate depth and CNOT counts for high-depth and wide circuits.

---

### **Assignment- 6**
- Exploring circuit knitting using Qiskit's `cut_gates` method to decompose distant CNOTs via quasi-probability decomposition and analyze sub-circuit depth and performance.

---

### **Assignment- 7**
- Implementing the Deutsch- Jozsa Algorithm for 3- bit Boolean functions and verifying whether each function is constant or balanced, using a single quantum query.
