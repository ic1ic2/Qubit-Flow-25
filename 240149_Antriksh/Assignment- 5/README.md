## Quantum Transpilation with AI

This notebook is a part of the IBM Quantum Challenge 2024, which aims at investigating how AI-assisted transpilation compares to traditional methods in optimizing quantum circuits for execution on real quantum hardware. The task involved setting up the Qiskit Transpiler Service, running both standard and AI-powered transpilation pipelines, and comparing the resulting circuits in terms of gate depth, total gate count, and CNOT count.

**Note** â€“ Since, the AI transpiler is currently in restricted access, some cells may not function correctly if valid authentication credentials or access rights are missing.
