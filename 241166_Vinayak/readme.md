# Assignments for the project [QubitFlow: Quantum Computing and Machine Learning](https://pclub.in/project/2025/05/26/qubitflow/) 



## Assignment 1: 
Implement a Quantum Teleportation Circuit in Python using Qiskit.

## Assingment 2:
Implement (on IBM-Q) digital simulations of the time-evolution of the two- and three-spin Heisenberg model, explaining what are the main differences in the two implementations.

## Assingment 3:
LAB: The Transpiler


## Assignment 4:
Assignment 2 was: Implement (on IBM-Q) digital simulations of the time-evolution of the two- and three-spin Heisenberg model, explaining what are the main differences in the two implementations.

Assignment 4 is a continuation of the same. 
1. Using the QASM simulation, compute estimates of various observables of the system as a function of time, and in particular of the dynamical correlation functions.
2. Run the simulation with the QASM simulator, including noise, and study how rapidly the quality of the solution deteriorates as a function of the time interval that is being simulated. This is done by computing the fidelity of the solution.
3. Discuss the origin of errors and, in particular, study the relative importance of the finite time step error (called Suzuki-Trotter error) and of the errors originating from the quantum hardware itself.
